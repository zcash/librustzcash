#   speeding up tests;
# - it does not set `codegen-units = 1`, which increases compile times and is only
#   useful to improve determinism of release builds;
# - it does not set `panic = 'abort'`, which is in any case ignored for tests.

# To get results as close as possible to a release build, use `cargo test --release`.
