WARNING: This certification is a result of a **partial** audit.  The
`any_zlib` code has **not** been audited.  Ability to track partial
audits is tracked in https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/380
Chromium does use the `any_zlib` feature(s).  Accidentally depending on
this feature in the future is prevented using the `ban_features` feature
of `gnrt` - see:
https://crrev.com/c/4723145/31/third_party/rust/chromium_crates_io/gnrt_config.toml

Security review of earlier versions of the crate can be found at
(Google-internal, sorry): go/image-crate-chromium-security-review

I grepped for `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bfs\b'`, `'\bnet\b'`, `'\bunsafe\b'`.

All `unsafe` in `flate2` is gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "any_zlib")]`:

* The code under `src/ffi/...` will not be used because the `mod c`
  declaration in `src/ffi/mod.rs` depends on the `any_zlib` config
* 7 uses of `unsafe` in `src/mem.rs` also all depend on the
  `any_zlib` config:
    - 2 in `fn set_dictionary` (under `impl Compress`)
    - 2 in `fn set_level` (under `impl Compress`)
    - 3 in `fn set_dictionary` (under `impl Decompress`)

All hits of `'\bfs\b'` are in comments, or example code, or test code
(but not in product code).

There were no hits of `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bnet\b'`.

Uses `unsafe` blocks to interact with `windows-sys` crate.
- `SHGetKnownFolderPath` safety requirements are met.
- `CoTaskMemFree` has no effect if passed `NULL`, so there is no issue if some
  future refactor created a pathway where `ffi::Guard` could be dropped before
  `SHGetKnownFolderPath` is called.
- Small nit: `ffi::Guard::as_pwstr` takes `&self` but returns `PWSTR` which is
  the mutable type; it should instead return `PCWSTR` which is the const type
  (and what `lstrlenW` takes) instead of implicitly const-casting the pointer,
  as this would better reflect the intent to take an immutable reference.
- The slice constructed from the `PWSTR` correctly goes out of scope before
  `guard` is dropped.
- A code comment says that `path_ptr` is valid for `len` bytes, but `PCWSTR` is
  a `*const u16` and `lstrlenW` returns its length \"in characters\" (which the
  Windows documentation confirms means the number of `WCHAR` values). This is
  likely a typo; the code checks that `len * size_of::<u16>() <= isize::MAX`.
