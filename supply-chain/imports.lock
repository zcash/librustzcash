All `unsafe` in `flate2` is gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "any_zlib")]`:

* The code under `src/ffi/...` will not be used because the `mod c`
  declaration in `src/ffi/mod.rs` depends on the `any_zlib` config

    - 2 in `fn set_level` (under `impl Compress`)
    - 3 in `fn set_dictionary` (under `impl Decompress`)

All hits of `'\bfs\b'` are in comments, or example code, or test code
(but not in product code).

There were no hits of `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bnet\b'`.

are used, which removes the implicit mul-by-cofactor during scalar multiplication (as the
last 3 bits of the scalar are no longer guaranteed to be zero). However, this happens to
be fine in the context of this crate:

- `SigningKey` does not expose its inner `Scalar` directly, so we only need to consider
  how it is used within the crate.
- For multiplication within a prime-order (sub)group, we get the same result whether we
  reduce before or not. This means that the field-element multiplication during signing,
  and the prime-order subgroup component of any group-element scalar multiplication, are
  unaffected.

Uses `unsafe` blocks to interact with `windows-sys` crate.
- `SHGetKnownFolderPath` safety requirements are met.
- `CoTaskMemFree` has no effect if passed `NULL`, so there is no issue if some
  future refactor created a pathway where `ffi::Guard` could be dropped before
  `SHGetKnownFolderPath` is called.
- Small nit: `ffi::Guard::as_pwstr` takes `&self` but returns `PWSTR` which is
  the mutable type; it should instead return `PCWSTR` which is the const type
  (and what `lstrlenW` takes) instead of implicitly const-casting the pointer,
  as this would better reflect the intent to take an immutable reference.
- The slice constructed from the `PWSTR` correctly goes out of scope before
  `guard` is dropped.
- A code comment says that `path_ptr` is valid for `len` bytes, but `PCWSTR` is
  a `*const u16` and `lstrlenW` returns its length \"in characters\" (which the
  Windows documentation confirms means the number of `WCHAR` values). This is
  likely a typo; the code checks that `len * size_of::<u16>() <= isize::MAX`.
