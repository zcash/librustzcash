//! The Partially Created Zcash Transaction (PCZT) format.
//!
//! Goal is to split up the parts of creating a transaction across distinct entities.
//! The entity roles roughly match BIP 174: Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction Format.
//! - Creator
//!   - Creates the base PCZT with no information about spends or outputs.
//! - Constructor
//!   - Adds spends and outputs to the PCZT.
//!   - A single entity is likely to be both a Creator and Constructor.
//! - Prover
//!   - Needs all private information for a single spend or output.
//!   - In practice, the Updater that adds a given spend or output will either act as
//!     the Prover themselves, or add the necessary data, offload to the Prover, and
//!     then receive back the PCZT with private data stripped and proof added.
//! - Signer
//!   - Needs the spend authorization randomizers to create signatures.
//!   - A Signer should only need to implement:
//!     - SignatureHash algorithm
//!     - Signatures (RedJubjub)
//!     - A source of randomness.
//! - Combiner
//!   - Combines several PCZTs that represent the same transaction into a single PCZT.
//!   - Because we aren't storing the partial transaction in network format, we need to
//!     carefully define equality for PCZTs.
//!     - If we say "pczt.global must be identical" then:
//!       - If we add spends or outputs in series, we should always update bsk when adding
//!         spends or outputs, even if rcv is present.
//!       - If we add spends or outputs in parallel and then combine, we must _never_ update
//!         bsk, and then update it when we prepare for signature creation.
//!       We can't control which happens, ergo we need an IO Finalizer step.
//!     - Once every spend and output has its zkproof field set, PCZT equality MUST include
//!       the SpendDescription and OutputDescription contents being identical.
//!       - In practice enforced by creating a TransactionData / CMutableTransaction from
//!         the PCZT, with spendAuthSigs and bindingSig empty, and then enforcing equality.
//!       - This is equivalent to BIP 147's equality definition (the partial transactions
//!         must be identical).
//! - Transaction Extractor
//!   - Creates bindingSig and extracts the final transaction.
