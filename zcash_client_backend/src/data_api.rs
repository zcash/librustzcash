//! # Utilities for Zcash wallet construction
//!
//! This module defines a set of APIs for wallet data persistence, and provides a suite of methods
//! based upon these APIs that can be used to implement a fully functional Zcash wallet. At
//! present, the interfaces provided here are built primarily around the use of a source of
//! [`CompactBlock`] data such as the Zcash Light Client Protocol as defined in
//! [ZIP 307](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0307) but they may be generalized to full-block use cases in
//! the future.
//!
//! ## Important Concepts
//!
//! There are several important operations that a Zcash wallet must perform that distinguish Zcash
//! wallet design from wallets for other cryptocurrencies.
//!
//! * Viewing Keys: Wallets based upon this module are built around the capabilities of Zcash
//!   [`UnifiedFullViewingKey`]s; the wallet backend provides no facilities for the storage
//!   of spending keys, and spending keys must be provided by the caller in order to perform
//!   transaction creation operations.
//! * Blockchain Scanning: A Zcash wallet must download and trial-decrypt each transaction on the
//!   Zcash blockchain using one or more Viewing Keys in order to find new shielded transaction
//!   outputs (generally termed "notes") belonging to the wallet. The primary entrypoint for this
//!   functionality is the [`scan_cached_blocks`] method. See the [`chain`] module for additional
//!   details.
//! * Witness Updates: In order to spend a shielded note, the wallet must be able to compute the
//!   Merkle path to that note in the global note commitment tree. When [`scan_cached_blocks`] is
//!   used to process a range of blocks, the note commitment tree is updated with the note
//!   commitments for the blocks in that range.
//! * Transaction Construction: The [`wallet`] module provides functions for creating Zcash
//!   transactions that spend funds belonging to the wallet.
//!
//! ## Core Traits
//!
//! The utility functions described above depend upon four important traits defined in this
//! module, which between them encompass the data storage requirements of a light wallet.
//! The relevant traits are [`InputSource`], [`WalletRead`], [`WalletWrite`], and
//! [`WalletCommitmentTrees`]. A complete implementation of the data storage layer for a wallet
//! will include an implementation of all four of these traits. See the [`zcash_client_sqlite`]
//! crate for a complete example of the implementation of these traits.
//!
//! ## Accounts
//!
//! The operation of the [`InputSource`], [`WalletRead`] and [`WalletWrite`] traits is built around
//! the concept of a wallet having one or more accounts, with a unique `AccountId` for each
//! account.
//!
//! An account identifier corresponds to at most a single [`UnifiedSpendingKey`]'s worth of spend
//! authority, with the received and spent notes of that account tracked via the corresponding
//! [`UnifiedFullViewingKey`]. Both received notes and change spendable by that spending authority
//! (both the external and internal parts of that key, as defined by
//! [ZIP 316](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0316)) will be interpreted as belonging to that account.

/// This trait encapsulates the write capabilities required to update stored wallet data.
///
/// # Adding accounts
///
/// This trait provides several methods for adding accounts to the wallet data:
/// - [`WalletWrite::create_account`]
/// - [`WalletWrite::import_account_hd`]
/// - [`WalletWrite::import_account_ufvk`]
///
/// All of these methods take an [`AccountBirthday`]. The birthday height is defined as
/// the minimum block height that will be scanned for funds belonging to the wallet. If
/// `birthday.height()` is below the current chain tip, the account addition operation
/// will trigger a re-scan of the blocks at and above the provided height.
///
/// The order in which you call these methods will affect the resulting wallet structure:
/// - If only [`WalletWrite::create_account`] is used, the resulting accounts will have
///   sequential [ZIP 32] account indices within each given seed.
/// - If [`WalletWrite::import_account_hd`] is used to import accounts with non-sequential
///   ZIP 32 account indices from the same seed, a call to [`WalletWrite::create_account`]
///   will use the ZIP 32 account index just after the highest-numbered existing account.
/// - If an account is added to the wallet, and then a later call to one of the methods
///   would produce the same UFVK, an error will be returned. While any combination of
///   method calls can cause this, there are two main ways it can occur that users of the
///   `WalletWrite` trait should watch out for:
///   - An account is created via [`WalletWrite::create_account`] with an auto-selected
///     ZIP 32 account index, and that index is later imported explicitly via either
///     [`WalletWrite::import_account_hd`] or [`WalletWrite::import_account_ufvk`].
///   - An account is imported via [`WalletWrite::import_account_ufvk`], and the ZIP 32
///     account index corresponding to that account's UFVK is later imported either
///     implicitly via [`WalletWrite::create_account`] or explicitly via
///     [`WalletWrite::import_account_hd`].
///
/// A future change to this trait might introduce a method to "upgrade" an imported
/// account with derivation information. See [zcash/librustzcash#1284] for details.
///
/// Users of the `WalletWrite` trait should generally distinguish in their APIs and wallet
/// UIs between creating a new account, and importing an account that previously existed.
/// By convention, wallets should only allow a new account to be generated after confirmed
/// funds have been received by the newest existing account; this allows automated account
/// recovery to discover and recover all funds within a particular seed.
///
/// # Creating a new wallet
///
/// To create a new wallet:
/// - Generate a new [BIP 39] mnemonic phrase, using a crate like [`bip0039`].
/// - Derive the corresponding seed from the mnemonic phrase.
/// - Use [`WalletWrite::create_account`] with the resulting seed.
///
/// Callers should construct the [`AccountBirthday`] using [`AccountBirthday::from_treestate`] for
/// the block at height `chain_tip_height - 100`. Setting the birthday height to a tree state below
/// the pruning depth ensures that reorgs cannot cause funds intended for the wallet to be missed;
/// otherwise, if the chain tip height were used for the wallet birthday, a transaction targeted at
/// a height greater than the chain tip could be mined at a height below that tip as part of a
/// reorg.
///
/// # Restoring a wallet from backup
///
/// To restore a backed-up wallet:
/// - Derive the seed from its BIP 39 mnemonic phrase.
/// - Use [`WalletWrite::import_account_hd`] once for each ZIP 32 account index that the
///   user wants to restore.
/// - If the highest previously-used ZIP 32 account index was _not_ restored by the user,
///   remember this index separately as `index_max`. The first time the user wants to
///   generate a new account, use [`WalletWrite::import_account_hd`] to create the account
///   `index_max + 1`.
/// - [`WalletWrite::create_account`] can be used to generate subsequent new accounts in
///   the restored wallet.
///
/// Automated account recovery has not yet been implemented by this crate. A wallet app
/// that supports multiple accounts can implement it manually by tracking account balances
/// relative to [`WalletSummary::fully_scanned_height`], and creating new accounts as
/// funds appear in existing accounts.
///
/// If the number of accounts is known in advance, the wallet should create all accounts before
/// scanning the chain so that the scan can be done in a single pass for all accounts.
