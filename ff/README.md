# ff

`ff` is a finite field library written in pure Rust, with no `unsafe{}` code.

## Disclaimers

* This library does not provide constant-time guarantees.

## Usage

Add the `ff` crate to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ff = "0.5"
```

The `ff` crate contains `Field`, `PrimeField`, `PrimeFieldRepr` and `SqrtField` traits.
See the **[documentation](https://docs.rs/ff/)** for more.

### #![derive(PrimeField)]

If you need an implementation of a prime field, this library also provides a procedural
macro that will expand into an efficient implementation of a prime field when supplied
with the modulus. `PrimeFieldGenerator` must be an element of Fp of p-1 order, that is
also quadratic nonresidue.

First, enable the `derive` crate feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
ff = { version = "0.4", features = ["derive"] }
```

And then use the macro like so:

```rust
extern crate rand;
#[macro_use]
extern crate ff;

#[derive(PrimeField)]
#[PrimeFieldModulus = "52435875175126190479447740508185965837690552500527637822603658699938581184513"]
#[PrimeFieldGenerator = "7"]
struct Fp(FpRepr);
```

And that's it! `Fp` now implements `Field` and `PrimeField`. `Fp` will also implement
`SqrtField` if supported. The library implements `FpRepr` itself and derives
`PrimeFieldRepr` for it.
