### 🛑 Use of this code may lead to a loss of funds 🛑

Use of this code in its current form or with modifications may lead to loss of funds, loss
of "expected" privacy, or denial of service for a large portion of users, or a bug which
could leverage any of those kinds of attacks (especially a "0 day" where we suspect few
people know about the vulnerability).

### :eyes: At this time, this is for preview purposes only. :eyes:
