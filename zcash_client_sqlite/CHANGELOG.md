# Changelog
All notable changes to this library will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this library adheres to Rust's notion of
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Implementations of `zcash_client_backend::data_api::WalletReadTransparent`
  and `WalletWriteTransparent` have been added. These implementations
  are available only when the `transparent-inputs` feature flag is
  enabled.
- New error variants:
  - `SqliteClientError::TransparentAddress`, to support handling of errors in
    transparent address decoding.
  - `SqliteClientError::RequestedRewindInvalid`, to report when requested
    rewinds exceed supported bounds.

### Changed
- MSRV is now 1.51.0.
- Bumped dependencies to `ff 0.11`, `group 0.11`, `jubjub 0.8`.
- Renamed the following to use lower-case abbreviations (matching Rust
  naming conventions):
  - `zcash_client_sqlite::BlockDB` to `BlockDb`
  - `zcash_client_sqlite::WalletDB` to `WalletDb`
  - `zcash_client_sqlite::error::SqliteClientError::IncorrectHRPExtFVK` to
    `IncorrectHrpExtFvk`.
- The SQLite implementations of `zcash_client_backend::data_api::WalletRead`
  and `WalletWrite` have been updated to reflect the changes to those
  traits.
- Renamed the following to reflect their Sapling-specific nature:
  - `zcash_client_sqlite::wallet`:
    - `get_spendable_notes` to `get_spendable_sapling_notes`.
    - `select_spendable_notes` to `select_spendable_sapling_notes`.
- Altered the arguments to `zcash_client_sqlite::wallet::put_sent_note`
  to take the components of a `DecryptedOutput` value to allow this
  method to be used in contexts where a transaction has just been
  constructed, rather than only in the case that a transaction has
  been decrypted after being retrieved from the network.

### Deprecated
- A number of public API methods that are used internally to support the
  `zcash_client_backend::data_api::{WalletRead, WalletWrite}` interfaces have
  been deprecated, and will be removed from the public API in a future release.
  Users should depend upon the versions of these methods exposed via the
  `zcash_client_backend::data_api` traits mentioned above instead.
  - Deprecated in `zcash_client_sqlite::wallet`:
    - `get_address`
    - `get_extended_full_viewing_keys`
    - `is_valid_account_extfvk`
    - `get_balance`
    - `get_balance_at`
    - `get_sent_memo`
    - `block_height_extrema`
    - `get_tx_height`
    - `get_block_hash`
    - `get_rewind_height`
    - `get_commitment_tree`
    - `get_witnesses`
    - `get_nullifiers`
    - `insert_block`
    - `put_tx_meta`
    - `put_tx_data`
    - `mark_sapling_note_spent`
    - `delete_utxos_above`
    - `put_receiverd_note`
    - `insert_witness`
    - `prune_witnesses`
    - `update_expired_notes`
    - `put_sent_note`
    - `put_sent_utxo`
    - `insert_sent_note`
    - `insert_sent_utxo`
    - `get_address`
  - Deprecated in `zcash_client_sqlite::wallet::transact`:
    - `get_spendable_sapling_notes`
    - `select_spendable_sapling_notes`

## [0.3.0] - 2021-03-26
This release contains a major refactor of the APIs to leverage the new Data
Access API in the `zcash_client_backend` crate. API names are almost all the
same as before, but have been reorganized.

### Added
- `zcash_client_sqlite::BlockDB`, a read-only wrapper for the SQLite connection
  to the block cache database.
- `zcash_client_sqlite::WalletDB`, a read-only wrapper for the SQLite connection
  to the wallet database.
- `zcash_client_sqlite::DataConnStmtCache`, a read-write wrapper for the SQLite
  connection to the wallet database. Returned by `WalletDB::get_update_ops`.
- `zcash_client_sqlite::NoteId`

### Changed
- MSRV is now 1.47.0.
- APIs now take `&BlockDB` and `&WalletDB<P>` arguments, instead of paths to the
  block cache and wallet databases.
- The library no longer uses the `mainnet` feature flag to specify the network
  type. APIs now take a `P: zcash_primitives::consensus::Parameters` variable.

### Removed
- `zcash_client_sqlite::address` module (moved to `zcash_client_backend`).

### Fixed
- Shielded transactions created by the wallet that have no change output (fully
  spending their input notes) are now correctly detected as mined when scanning
  compact blocks.
- Unshielding transactions created by the wallet (with a transparent recipient
  address) that have no change output no longer cause a panic.

## [0.2.1] - 2020-10-24
### Fixed
- `transact::create_to_address` now correctly reconstructs notes from the data
  DB after Canopy activation (zcash/librustzcash#311). This is critcal to correct
  operation of spends after Canopy.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-09-09
### Changed
- MSRV is now 1.44.1.
- Bumped dependencies to `ff 0.8`, `group 0.8`, `jubjub 0.5.1`, `protobuf 2.15`,
  `rusqlite 0.24`, `zcash_primitives 0.4`, `zcash_client_backend 0.4`.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-08-24
Initial release.
