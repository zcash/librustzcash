//! Documentation about the wallet database structure.
//!
//! The database structure is managed by [`crate::wallet::init::WalletMigrator`], which
//! applies migrations (defined in `crate::wallet::init::migrations`) that produce the
//! current structure.
//!
//! The SQL code in this module's constants encodes the current database structure, as
//! represented internally by SQLite. We do not use these constants at runtime; instead we
//! check the output of the migrations in `crate::wallet::init::tests::verify_schema`, to
//! pin the expected database structure.

// The constants in this module are only used in tests, but `#[cfg(test)]` prevents them
// from showing up in `cargo doc --document-private-items`.

/// Stores information about the accounts that the wallet is tracking.
///
/// An account corresponds to a logical "bucket of funds" that has its own balance within the
/// wallet and for which spending operations should treat received value as interchangeable,
/// excepting situations where care must be taken to avoid publicly linking addresses within the
/// account or where turnstile-crossings may have privacy implications.
///
/// ### Columns
///
/// - `id`: Internal primary key for the account record.
/// - `name`: A human-readable reference for the account. This column is present merely as a
///   convenience for front-ends and debugging; it has no stable semantics and values are not
///   required to be unique.
/// - `uuid`: A wallet-instance-specific identifier for the account. This identifier will remain
///   stable for the lifetime of the wallet database, but is not expected or required to be
///   stable across wallet restores and it should not be stored in external backup formats.
/// - `account_kind`: 0 for accounts derived from a mnemonic seed, 1 for imported accounts
///   for which derivation path information may not be available. This column may be removed in the
///   future; the distinction between whether an account is derived or imported is better
///   represented by the presence or absence of HD seed fingerprint and HD account index data.
/// - `hd_seed_fingerprint`: If this account contains funds in keys obtained via HD derivation,
///   the ZIP 32 fingerprint of the root HD seed. If this column is non-null, `hd_account_index`
///   must also be non-null.
/// - `hd_account_index`: If this account contains funds in keys obtained via HD derivation,
///   the BIP 44 account-level component of the HD derivation path. If this column is non-null,
///   `hd_seed_fingerprint` must also be non-null.
/// - `ufvk`: The unified full viewing key for the account, if known.
/// - `uivk`: The unified incoming viewing key for the account.
/// - `orchard_fvk_item_cache`: The serialized representation of the Orchard item of the `ufvk`,
///   if any.
/// - `sapling_fvk_item_cache`: The serialized representation of the Sapling item of the `ufvk`,
///   if any.
/// - `p2pkh_fvk_item_cache`: The serialized representation of the P2PKH item of the `ufvk`,
///   if any.
/// - `birthday_height`: The minimum block height among blocks that may potentially contain
///   shielded funds belonging to the account.
/// - `birthday_sapling_tree_size`: A cache of the size of the Sapling note commitment tree
///   as of the start of the birthday block.
/// - `birthday_orchard_tree_size`: A cache of the size of the Orchard note commitment tree
///   as of the start of the birthday block.
/// - `recover_until_height`: The boundary between recovery and regular scanning for this account.
///   Unscanned blocks up to and excluding this height are counted towards recovery progress. It
///   is initially set via the `AccountBirthday` parameter of the `WalletWrite::import_account_*`
///   methods (usually to the chain tip height at which account recovery was initiated), and may
///   in future be automatically updated by the backend if the wallet is offline for an extended
///   period (to keep the scan progress percentage accurate to what actually needs scanning).
/// - `has_spend_key`: A boolean flag (0 or 1) indicating whether the application that embeds
///   this wallet database has access to spending key(s) for the account.
/// - `zcash_legacy_address_index`: This column is only potentially populated for wallets imported
///   from a `zcashd` `wallet.dat` file, for "standalone" Sapling addresses (each of which
///   corresponds to an independent account) derived after the introduction of mnemonic seed
///   derivation in the `4.7.0` `zcashd` release. This column will only be non-negative in
///   the case that the `hd_account_index` column has the value `0x7FFFFFFF`, in accordance with
///   how post-v4.7.0 Sapling addresses were produced by the `z_getnewaddress` RPC method.
///   This relationship is not currently enforced by a CHECK constraint; such a constraint should
///   be added the next time that the `accounts` table is deleted and re-created to support a
///   SQLite-breaking change to the columns of the table.

///   addresses, this may be an internal-scope (change) address, so that we can provide
///   compatibility with HD-derived change addresses produced by transparent-only wallets.
/// - `transparent_child_index`: the diversifier index in integer form, if it is in the range of a  `u31`
///   (i.e. a non-hardened transparent address index). It is used for gap limit handling, and is set
///   whenever a transparent address at a given index should be scanned at receive time. This
///   includes:
///   - Unified Addresses with transparent receivers (at any valid index).
///   - Unified Addresses without transparent receivers, but within the gap limit of potential
///     sequential transparent addresses.
///   - Transparent change addresses.
///   - ZIP 320 ephemeral addresses.
///
///   This column exists because the diversifier index is stored as a byte array, meaning that we
///   cannot use SQL integer operations on it for gap limit calculations, and thus need it as an
///   integer as well.
/// - `cached_transparent_receiver_address`: the transparent address derived from the same
///   viewing key and at the same diversifier index as `address`. This may be the same as `address`
///   in the case of an internal-scope transparent change address or a ZIP 320 interstitial
///   address, and it may be a receiver within `address` in the case of a Unified Address with
///   transparent receiver. It is cached directly in the table to make account lookups for
///   transparent outputs more efficient, enabling joins to [`TABLE_TRANSPARENT_RECEIVED_OUTPUTS`].
/// - `exposed_at_height`: Our best knowledge as to when this address was first exposed to the
///   wider ecosystem.
///   - For user-generated addresses, this is the chain tip height at the time that the address was
///     generated by an explicit request by the user or reserved for use in a ZIP 320 transaction.
///     These heights are not recoverable from chain.
///   - In the case of an address with its first use discovered in a transaction obtained by scanning
///     the chain, this will be set to the mined height of that transaction. In recover from seed
///     cases, this is what user-generated addresses will be assigned.
/// - `receiver_flags`: A set of bitflags that describes which receiver types are included in
///   `address`. See the documentation of [`ReceiverFlags`] for details.
/// - `transparent_receiver_next_check_time`: The Unix epoch time at which a client should next
///   check to determine whether any new UTXOs have been received by the cached transparent receiver
///   address. At present, this will ordinarily be populated only for ZIP 320 ephemeral addresses.
//  - `imported_transparent_receiver_pubkey`: The 33-byte pubkey corresponding to the
//    `cached_transparent_receiver_address` value, for imported transparent addresses that were not
//    obtained via derivation from an HD seed associated with the account. In cases that
//    `cached_transparent_receiver_address` is non-null, either this column or

/// - `to_address`: the address of the external recipient of this output, or `NULL` if the
///   output was received by the wallet.
/// - `to_account_id`: the ID of the account that received this output, or `NULL` if the
///   output was for an external recipient.
/// - `value`: the value of the output in zatoshis.
/// - `memo`: the memo bytes associated with this output, if known.
///   - This is always `NULL` for transparent outputs.
///   - This will be set for all shielded outputs of transactions created by the wallet.
///   - On recover-from-seed or when scanning by UFVK, this will only be set for shielded
///     outputs after post-scanning transaction enhancement. For shielded notes sent to
///     external recipients, the transaction needs to have been created with an
