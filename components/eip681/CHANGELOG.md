# Changelog

All notable changes to this library will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this library adheres to Rust's notion of
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Future releases are
indicated by the `PLANNED` status in order to make it possible to correctly
represent the transitive `semver` implications of changes within the enclosing
workspace.
