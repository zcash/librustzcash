//! Equihash is a Proof-of-Work algorithm, based on a generalization of the Birthday
//! problem which finds colliding hash values. It was designed to be memory-hard; more
//! specifically, the bottle-neck for parallel implementations of Equihash solvers would
//! be memory bandwidth.
//!
//! This crate implements Equihash as specified for the Zcash consensus rules. It can
//! verify solutions for any valid `(n, k)` parameters, as long as the row indices are no
//! larger than 32 bits (that is, `ceiling(((n / (k + 1)) + 1) / 8) <= 4`).
